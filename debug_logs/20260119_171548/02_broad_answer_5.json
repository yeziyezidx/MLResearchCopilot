"{\"summary\": \"**Post-retrieval evidence extraction** refers to the process of refining, filtering, or auditing the information retrieved in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline before it is used by a language model to generate responses. The goal is to improve faithfulness, relevance, and efficiency by removing noise, ensuring methodological rigor, and extracting only the most pertinent evidence.  \\n\\nIn current RAG architectures, retrieval can introduce irrelevant or low-quality content (“retrieval noise”) that distracts the model or introduces factual errors. Post-retrieval evidence extraction addresses this by applying specialized algorithms or models to:  \\n- Identify relevant and high-quality evidence  \\n- Discard noisy or misleading snippets  \\n- Optimize the length and informativeness of the context supplied to the generator  \\n\\nRecent research has moved beyond heuristic filtering toward **model-based, reasoning-driven, and auditing-focused approaches**:  \\n\\n1. **Model-based extraction (SEER)** – SEER (Self-Aligned Evidence Extraction) replaces hand-crafted filters with a learned evidence extractor trained via self-aligned learning. It optimizes for faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness, achieving a 9.25× reduction in evidence length without sacrificing quality, thereby improving computational efficiency and RAG performance.\\n\\n2. **Reasoning-driven extraction (EviOmni)** – EviOmni integrates explicit reasoning and conscious extraction in a unified end-to-end framework. It uses reinforcement learning with reward functions based on answer correctness, evidence length, and format compliance. This approach aims to avoid missing subtle but critical cues while producing compact, high-quality evidence.\\n\\n3. **Methodological auditing (VeriRAG)** – VeriRAG focuses on scientific content, introducing a post-retrieval auditing framework that detects methodological flaws (“methodological blindness”) in cited sources. It uses small language models to evaluate statistical rigor against a specialized taxonomy, producing structured audit trails for human editors. This addresses the problem of treating all sources as equally valid regardless of methodological quality.\\n\\nCollectively, these developments point toward **more intelligent, context-aware, and quality-sensitive post-retrieval evidence handling**, integrating reasoning, learning, and domain-specific validation into RAG pipelines. This trend is especially relevant for high-stakes domains such as science communication, fact-checking, and legal or medical applications, where evidence quality is paramount.\", \"problem\": null, \"key_concepts\": [\"- **Post-retrieval evidence extraction** – Refining retrieved information before generation to improve relevance and reduce noise.\", \"- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Combining information retrieval with language model generation to improve factual accuracy.\", \"- **Retrieval noise** – Irrelevant or misleading content in retrieved data that can degrade model output quality.\", \"- **Self-aligned learning (SEER)** – Training an evidence extractor to align with desired quality metrics without relying on hand-crafted rules.\", \"- **Evidence reasoning (EviOmni)** – Explicitly reasoning about retrieved content to identify useful cues before extraction.\", \"- **Reinforcement learning for evidence extraction** – Using reward functions to optimize extraction strategies.\", \"- **Methodological blindness** – The tendency of systems to treat all cited evidence as equally valid without assessing methodological rigor.\", \"- **Auditable taxonomy of statistical rigor (VeriRAG)** – A structured framework for evaluating the methodological soundness of scientific papers.\"], \"recent_developments\": [\"- Shift from heuristic-based filtering to **model-based extraction** (SEER) that improves generalization and efficiency.\", \"- Integration of **reasoning and extraction** into a single process (EviOmni), with reinforcement learning rewards to guide high-quality evidence selection.\", \"- Emergence of **domain-specific auditing frameworks** (VeriRAG) that evaluate methodological soundness, especially in scientific domains.\", \"- Demonstrated efficiency gains, such as SEER’s large reduction in evidence length and EviOmni’s compact but accurate evidence generation.\", \"- Use of **small language models** for targeted auditing tasks to improve scalability and transparency.\"], \"authoritative_sources\": [\"- **SEER** – Xinping Zhao, Dongfang Li, Yan Zhong, Boren Hu, Yibin Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang. *Self-Aligned Evidence Extraction for Retrieval-Augmented Generation*.

Existing methods heavily rely on heuristic-based augmentation, encountering several issues: (1) Poor generalization due to hand-crafted context filtering; (2) Semantics deficiency due to rule-based context chunking; (3) Skewed length due to sentence-wise filter learning. To address these issues, we propose a model-based evidence extraction learning framework, SEER, optimizing a vanilla model as an evidence extractor with desired properties through self-aligned learning. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves the final RAG performance, enhances the faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness of the extracted evidence, and reduces the evidence length by 9.25 times.

However, re-trieval noises significantly impact the qual-ity of LLMs’ generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straight-forwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose EviOmni, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to iden-tify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for an-swering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to up-date the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of EviOmni, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems1.</P><H3>1 Introduction</H3><P>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models (LLMs).

In ideal conditions, LLMs should be grounded on purely relevant retrieval contents to generate accurate output and also facilitate infer-ence. However, due to imperfect retrieval systems or noisy data in the retrieval corpus (Wang et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024a), the re-trieval contents usually contain lots of irrelevant or noisy snippets, which distract LLMs’ attention and also inflict a heavy blow on the generation quality of LLMs. Therefor\", \"source\": \"bing\"}, {\"title\": \"VeriRAG: A Post-Retrieval Auditing of Scientific Study Summaries\", \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/html/2507.17948v2\", \"snippet\": \"<H1>VeriRAG: A Post-Retrieval Auditing of Scientific Study Summaries</H1><P>Shubham Mohole1, Hongjun Choi2, Shusen Liu2, Christine Klymko2,\\nShashank Kushwaha3, Derek Shi4, Wesam Sakla2, Sainyam Galhotra1, Ruben Glatt2\\n1Cornell University, USA\\n2Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA\\n3University of Illinois Urbana‑Champaign, USA\\n4University of California, Los Angeles, USA</P><H6>Abstract</H6><P>Can democratized information gatekeepers and community note writers effectively decide what scientific information to amplify? Lacking domain expertise, such gatekeepers rely on automated reasoning agents that use RAG to ground evidence to cited sources. But such standard RAG systems validate summaries via semantic grounding and suffer from “methodological blindness,” treating all cited evidence as equally valid regardless of rigor. To address this, we introduce VeriRAG, a post-retrieval auditing framework that shifts the task from classification to methodological vulnerability detection. Using private Small Language Models (SLMs), VeriRAG audits source papers against the Veritable taxonomy of statistical rigor. We contribute: (1) a benchmark of 1,730 summaries with realistic, non-obvious perturbations modeled after retracted papers; (2) the auditable Veritable taxonomy; and (3) an operational system that improves Macro F1 by at least 19 points over baselines using GPT-based SLMs, a result that replicates across MISTRAL and Gemma architectures. Given the complexity of detecting non-obvious flaws, we view VeriRAG as a “vulnerability-detection copilot,” providing structured audit trails for human editors. In our experiments, individual human testers found over 80% of the generated audit trails useful for decision-making. We plan to release the dataset and code to support responsible science advocacy.</P><H2>1 Introduction</H2><P>Today, science journalists and social media moderators act as ‘amplification stations’ kasperson1988social, where poorly vetted studies erode public trust ophir2021effects.
