To address this, we introduce VERIRAG, a post-retrieval auditing framework that shifts the task from classification to methodological vulnerability detection. Using private Small Language Models (SLMs), VERIRAG audits source papers against the Veritable taxonomy of statistical rigor. We contribute: (1) a benchmark of 1,730 summaries with realistic, non-obvious perturbations modeled after retracted papers; (2) the auditable Veritable taxonomy; and (3) an operational system that improves Macro F1 by at least 19 points over baselines using GPT-based SLMs, a result that replicates across MISTRAL and Gemma architectures.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external knowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved contexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries. This challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness, which current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to address adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous internal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset (NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce Confidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval based on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing knowledge conflicts and improving efficiency.

As the name suggests, we combine behavioral-programming(BP) - a scenario-based modeling paradigm - with context idioms that explicitly specify when scenarios are relevant and what information they need. The core idea is to connect the behavioral model with a data model that represents the context, allowing an intuitive connection between the models via update and select queries. Combining behavioral-programming with context-oriented programming brings the best of the two worlds, solving issues that arise when using each of the approaches in separation.\\n  We begin with providing abstract semantics for COBP, laying the foundations for applying reasoning algorithms to context-aware behavioral programs. We then exemplify the semantics with formal specifications of systems, including a variant of Conway's Game of Life. Finally, we present a JavaScript-based implementation of the paradigm and provide two case studies of real-life context-aware systems (one in robotics and another in IoT) that were developed using this tool.

To accurately model user representations over time, recent studies in sequential recommendation utilize information propagation and evolution to mine from batches of arriving interactions. However, they ignore the fact that people are easily influenced by the recent actions of other users in the contextual scenario, and applying evolution across all historical interactions dilutes the importance of recent ones, thus failing to model the evolution of dynamic interest accurately. To address this issue, we propose a Context-Aware Pseudo-Multi-Task Recommender System (CPMR) to model the evolution in both historical and contextual scenarios by creating three representations for each user and item under different dynamics: static embedding, historical temporal states, and contextual temporal states. To dually improve the performance of temporal states evolution and incremental recommendation, we design a Pseudo-Multi-Task Learning (PMTL) paradigm by stacking the incremental single-target recommendations into one multi-target task for joint optimization. Within the PMTL paradigm, CPMR employs a shared-bottom network to conduct the evolution of temporal states across historical and contextual scenarios, as well as the fusion of them at the user-item level. In addition, CPMR incorporates one real tower for incremental predictions, and two pseudo towers dedicated to updating the respective temporal states based on new batches of interactions.

Image captioning can be translated to the task of sequential language prediction given visual content, where the output sequence forms natural language description with plausible grammar. However, existing image captioning methods focus only on language policy while not visual policy, and thus fail to capture visual context that are crucial for compositional reasoning such as object relationships (e.g., \\\"man riding horse\\\") and visual comparisons (e.g., \\\"small(er) cat\\\"). This issue is especially severe when generating longer sequences such as a paragraph. To fill the gap, we propose a Context-Aware Visual Policy network (CAVP) for fine-grained image-to-language generation: image sentence captioning and image paragraph captioning. During captioning, CAVP explicitly considers the previous visual attentions as context, and decides whether the context is used for the current word/sentence generation given the current visual attention. Compared against traditional visual attention mechanism that only fixes a single visual region at each step, CAVP can attend to complex visual compositions over time. The whole image captioning model -- CAVP and its subsequent language policy network -- can be efficiently optimized end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient method.

In this problem, each agent has a local cost, and the goal for the agents is to collectively find a minimum of their aggregate cost. A standard algorithm to solve this problem is the iterative distributed gradient-descent (DGD) method being implemented collaboratively by the server and the agents. In the synchronous setting, the algorithm proceeds from one iteration to the next only after all the agents complete their expected communication with the server. However, such synchrony can be expensive and even infeasible in real-world applications. We show that waiting for all the agents is unnecessary in many applications of distributed optimization, including distributed machine learning, due to redundancy in the cost functions (or {\\\\em data}). Specifically, we consider a generic notion of redundancy named $(r,ε)$-redundancy implying solvability of the original multi-agent optimization problem with $ε$ accuracy, despite the removal of up to $r$ (out of total $n$) agents from the system. We present an asynchronous DGD algorithm where in each iteration the server only waits for (any) $n-r$ agents, instead of all the $n$ agents. Assuming $(r,ε)$-redundancy, we show that our asynchronous algorithm converges to an approximate solution with error that is linear in $ε$ and $r$.

Vendi-RAG leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to promote semantic diversity in document retrieval.

This process is applied to the dataset generated in this paper and a public dataset (Places365) achieving a 9.5% and 27% of extra labels in each dataset respectively, therefore demonstrating that the presented system can robustly enrich the initial dataset.\", \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05623v1\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2020-05-12T08:57:59Z\", \"score_bm25\": 1.424657773896932}, {\"paper_id\": \"1902.04790v1\", \"title\": \"SaGe: Web Preemption for Public SPARQL Query Services\", \"authors\": [\"Thomas Minier\", \"Hala Skaf-Molli\", \"Pascal Molli\"], \"abstract\": \"To provide stable and responsive public SPARQL query services, data providers enforce quotas on server usage. Queries which exceed these quotas are interrupted and deliver partial results. Such interruption is not an issue if it is possible to resume queries execution afterward. Unfortunately, there is no preemption model for the Web that allows for suspending and resuming SPARQL queries. In this paper, we propose SaGe: a SPARQL query engine based on Web preemption. SaGe allows SPARQL queries to be suspended by the Web server after a fixed time quantum and resumed upon client request. Web preemption is tractable only if its cost in time is negligible compared to the time quantum. The challenge is to support the full SPARQL query language while keeping the cost of preemption negligible. Experimental results demonstrate that SaGe outperforms existing SPARQL query processing approaches by several orders of magnitude in term of the average total query execution time and the time for first results.\", \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04790v1\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2019-02-13T08:53:59Z\", \"score_bm25\": 1.338571633393558}, {\"paper_id\": \"1806.07158v2\", \"title\": \"You, the Web and Your Device: Longitudinal Characterization of Browsing Habits\", \"authors\": [\"Luca Vassio\", \"Idilio Drago\", \"Marco Mellia\", \"Zied Ben Houidi\", \"Mohamed Lamine Lamali\"], \"abstract\": \"Understanding how people interact with the web is key for a variety of applications, e.g., from the design of effective web pages to the definition of successful online marketing campaigns. Browsing behavior has been traditionally represented and studied by means of clickstreams, i.e., graphs whose vertices are web pages, and edges are the paths followed by users. Obtaining large and representative data to extract clickstreams is however challenging. The evolution of the web questions whether browsing behavior is changing and, by consequence, whether properties of clickstreams are changing. This paper presents a longitudinal study of clickstreams in from 2013 to 2016. We evaluate an anonymized dataset of HTTP traces captured in a large ISP, where thousands of households are connected. We first propose a methodology to identify actual URLs requested by users from the massive set of requests automatically fired by browsers when rendering web pages. Then, we characterize web usage patterns and clickstreams, taking into account both the temporal evolution and the impact of the device used to explore the web. Our analyses precisely quantify various aspects of clickstreams and uncover interesting patterns, such as the typical short paths followed by people while navigating the web, the fast increasing trend in browsing from mobile devices and the different roles of search engines and social networks in promoting content. Finally, we contribute a dataset of anonymized clickstreams to the community to foster new studies (anonymized clickstreams are available to the public at http://bigdata.polito.it/clickstream).\", \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07158v2\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2018-06-19T11:25:32Z\", \"score_bm25\": 1.2287822998902131}, {\"paper_id\": \"2507.11773v1\", \"title\": \"Small Data Explainer -- The impact of small data methods in everyday life\", \"authors\": [\"Maren Hackenberg\", \"Sophia G.

However, there is a scarcity of labeled data in current RSIOD datasets, which significantly limits the performance of current detection algorithms. Although existing techniques, e.g., data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, can mitigate this scarcity issue to some extent, they are heavily dependent on high-quality labeled data and perform worse in rare object classes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a layout-controllable diffusion generative model (i.e. AeroGen) tailored for RSIOD. To our knowledge, AeroGen is the first model to simultaneously support horizontal and rotated bounding box condition generation, thus enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic images that meet specific layout and object category requirements. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation framework that integrates a diversity-conditioned generator and a filtering mechanism to enhance both the diversity and quality of generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data produced by our method are of high quality and diversity. Furthermore, the synthetic RSIOD data can significantly improve the detection performance of existing RSIOD models, i.e., the mAP metrics on DIOR, DIOR-R, and HRSC datasets are improved by 3.7%, 4.3%, and 2.43%, respectively.

A PAM4 encoder plus a VCSEL driver will be implemented in the same die to use the same clock system, eliminating the need of CDRs in the PAM4 encoder. This way the transmitter module, GBT20, developed using the GBS20 ASIC, will have the exact lpGBT data interface and transmission protocol, with an output up to 20.48 Gbps over one fiber. With PAM4 embedded FPGAs at the receiving end, GBT20 will halve the fibers needed in a system and better use the input bandwidth of the FPGA.

An internal PRBS generator provides data to the serializers. GBS20v0 is tested barely up to 20.48 Gbps.
