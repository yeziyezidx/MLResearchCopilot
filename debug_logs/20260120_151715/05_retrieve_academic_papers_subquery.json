However, we find that existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop-RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in practice.

We evaluate our approach against a standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base.

However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance.

An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM. Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations, including a Needle in a Haystack test, show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our experiences building an LLM application for real-world use.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483v2\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07483v2\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2024-02-12T08:45:08Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": null, \"title\": \"GitHub - happymondaynkanta/Web-RAG-Pipeline-Intelligent-Website-Knowledge-Assistant: An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that crawls websites, cleans and extracts text, splits documents into chunks, generates semantic embeddings with HuggingFace, stores them in ChromaDB.

Zhu\", \"Jiawei Han\", \"Jingrui He\"], \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with an external knowledge base to improve the answer relevance and accuracy. In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance. Also, under T-RAG, we evaluate the inference ability upgrade of different LLMs. Code and Data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01346v4\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01346v4\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2025-04-02T04:24:41Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"2412.12881v1\", \"title\": \"RAG-Star: Enhancing Deliberative Reasoning with Retrieval Augmented Verification and Refinement\", \"authors\": [\"Jinhao Jiang\", \"Jiayi Chen\", \"Junyi Li\", \"Ruiyang Ren\", \"Shijie Wang\", \"Wayne Xin Zhao\", \"Yang Song\", \"Tao Zhang\"], \"abstract\": \"Existing large language models (LLMs) show exceptional problem-solving capabilities but might struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Despite the successes of chain-of-thought and tree-based search methods, they mainly depend on the internal knowledge of LLMs to search over intermediate reasoning steps, limited to dealing with simple tasks involving fewer reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose \\\\textbf{RAG-Star}, a novel RAG approach that integrates the retrieved information to guide the tree-based deliberative reasoning process that relies on the inherent knowledge of LLMs. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, RAG-Star iteratively plans intermediate sub-queries and answers for reasoning based on the LLM itself. To consolidate internal and external knowledge, we propose an retrieval-augmented verification that utilizes query- and answer-aware reward modeling to provide feedback for the inherent reasoning of LLMs. Our experiments involving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o demonstrate that RAG-Star significantly outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12881v1\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12881v1\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2024-12-17T13:05:36Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"2511.22858v1\", \"title\": \"RAG System for Supporting Japanese Litigation Procedures: Faithful Response Generation Complying with Legal Norms\", \"authors\": [\"Yuya Ishihara\", \"Atsushi Keyaki\", \"Hiroaki Yamada\", \"Ryutaro Ohara\", \"Mihoko Sumida\"], \"abstract\": \"This study discusses the essential components that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLM system should possess in order to support Japanese medical litigation procedures complying with legal norms. In litigation, expert commissioners, such as physicians, architects, accountants, and engineers, provide specialized knowledge to help judges clarify points of dispute. When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand. This paper discusses the design of a RAG-based LLM system that satisfies these requirements.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22858v1\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22858v1\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2025-11-28T03:28:27Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"2502.13957v2\", \"title\": \"RAG-Gym: Systematic Optimization of Language Agents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"authors\": [\"Guangzhi Xiong\", \"Qiao Jin\", \"Xiao Wang\", \"Yin Fang\", \"Haolin Liu\", \"Yifan Yang\", \"Fangyuan Chen\", \"Zhixing Song\", \"Dengyu Wang\", \"Minjia Zhang\", \"Zhiyong Lu\", \"Aidong Zhang\"], \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown great promise for knowledge-intensive tasks and recently advanced with agentic RAG, where language agents engage in multi-round interactions with external knowledge sources for adaptive information retrieval. However, existing agentic RAG methods often depend on ad-hoc prompt engineering and lack a unified optimization framework. We introduce RAG-Gym, a comprehensive platform that systematically explores three optimization dimensions: (1) prompt engineering, (2) actor tuning, and (3) critic training. For prompt engineering, we propose Re$^2$Search, a novel agent incorporating reasoning reflection that significantly outperforms standard prompts. In actor tuning, we evaluate three popular post-training algorithms with fine-grained process supervision and identify direct preference optimization as the most effective. We further demonstrate that a trained critic can enhance inference by selecting higher-quality intermediate reasoning steps. Together, these findings lead to the optimized Re$^2$Search++ agent, which surpasses most recent methods like Search-R1 by a relative increase of 3.2% to 11.6% in average F1. Finally, we examine the impact of different reward sources and analyze scaling properties in training and inference, offering practical insights for agentic RAG optimization.

Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhorse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge; however, existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, where data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction. To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 250 explanation and navigation queries across kilometer-level environments, highlighting its promise as a general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18313v5\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18313v5\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2024-09-26T21:44:11Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}], \"HTML parsing for information retrieval\": [{\"paper_id\": null, \"title\": \"Semantic-Sensitive Web Information Retrieval Model for HTML Documents\", \"authors\": [\"Youssef Bassil\", \"Paul Semaan\"], \"abstract\": \"With the advent of the Internet, a new era of digital information exchange has begun. Currently, the Internet encompasses more than five billion online sites and this number is exponentially increasing every day. Fundamentally, Information Retrieval (IR) is the science and practice of storing documents and retrieving information from within these documents. Mathematically, IR systems are at the core based on a feature vector model coupled with a term weighting scheme that weights terms in a document according to their significance with respect to the context in which they appear. Practically, Vector Space Model (VSM), Term Frequency (TF), and Inverse Term Frequency (IDF) are among other long-established techniques employed in mainstream IR systems. However, present IR models only target generic-type text documents, in that, they do not consider specific formats of files such as HTML web documents. This paper proposes a new semantic-sensitive web information retrieval model for HTML documents. It consists of a vector model called SWVM and a weighting scheme called BTF-IDF, particularly designed to support the indexing and retrieval of HTML web documents. The chief advantage of the proposed model is that it assigns extra weights for terms that appear in certain pre-specified HTML tags that are correlated to the semantics of the document. Additionally, the model is semantic-sensitive as it generates synonyms for every term being indexed and later weights them appropriately to increase the likelihood of retrieving documents with similar context but different vocabulary terms. Experiments conducted, revealed a momentous enhancement in the precision of web IR systems and a radical increase in the number of relevant documents being retrieved. As further research, the proposed model is to be upgraded so as to support the indexing and retrieval of web images in multimedia-rich web documents.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0186v1\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0186v1\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2012-04-01T09:50:42Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": null, \"title\": \"Editorial for the Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval Workshop at ECIR 2014\", \"authors\": [\"Philipp Mayr\", \"Philipp Schaer\", \"Andrea Scharnhorst\", \"Peter Mutschke\"], \"abstract\": \"This first \\\"Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval\\\" (BIR 2014) workshop aims to engage with the IR community about possible links to bibliometrics and scholarly communication.

TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases. Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context. The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information. Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs. The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities.

Let’s check out some more benefits of NER:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced user experience</strong>: NER improves customer experience by providing better search results and personalized recommendations.</li><li><strong>Simple analysis of data and trends</strong>: NER makes it easier to analyze data to identify tendencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Automated workflows</strong>:&nbsp;NER automates processes, which helps save our time and resources.</li></ul><h3>Any Limitations of NER?</h3><p>Now let's look at some&nbsp;named entity recognition challenges:</p><ul><li><strong>Context misunderstanding</strong>:&nbsp;algorithms often struggle to understand context because words get meaning from the surrounding text. For example, the word \\\"Bat\\\" can mean a flying animal or a baseball tool (depending on the context).</li><li><strong>Language variation</strong>:&nbsp;human language includes slang, dialects, and regional differences, which can make it harder to understand words that are common in one place but not in another.</li><li><strong>Data sparsity</strong>: machine learning models need a lot of labeled data to identify entities. This can be difficult to find, especially for rare languages or specialized areas.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\\\"Article_contentStyles__FOoh1\\\" data-id=\\\"1801\\\"><h2>How Named-entity Recognition Works?</h2><div class=\\\"\\\"><p>Named&nbsp;Entity Recognition&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://sapient.pro/natural-language-processing-services\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">NLP&nbsp;</a>uses unique algorithms with grammar rules and statistical models to find and tag names in text.

In tagging, each word in a sentence is labeled with tags like “Person” or “Location”.&nbsp; We’ll explain what techniques NER uses:&nbsp;</p><h3>IO Tagging</h3><p>In this simple tagging method, each word in a sentence is tagged as “inside” (I) if it's part of an entity or “outside” (O) if it's not.</p><p>In the sentence “Sara is going to London,” the words “Sara” and “London” are tagged as entities (I tag), while the words \\\"is,\\\" \\\"going,\\\" and \\\"to\\\" are not entities (O tag).</p><p>This method has limitations, especially with tagging consecutive entities of the same type.</p><h3>BIO / IOB Tagging</h3><p>IOB is a widely used tagging method. This system labels each word to show if it is at the beginning (B) of a named entity, inside (I) of a named entity, or outside (O) of any named entity.</p><p>In the sentence “Sara is going to London,” “Sara” is marked as “B-PER” to show it's the start of a person's name, while “London” is tagged as “I-LOC” because it's a place.</p><h3>IOE Tagging</h3><p>This approach is similar to IOB, but it uses an&nbsp;E tag&nbsp;to mark the end of an entity instead of the beginning.</p><h3>BILOU Tagging</h3><p>BILOU is a more detailed version of the BIO labeling system that detects entities. It includes two extra labels, Last (L) and Unit (U), to improve&nbsp;ner metrics accuracy, especially with longer entities.</p><p>In a sentence like “Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco,” BILOU tagging would be: Steve —&nbsp;&nbsp;B-PER (beginning of a Person entity), Jobs —&nbsp;&nbsp;L-PER (last token of a Person entity), was —&nbsp;&nbsp;O (outside any named entity), born —&nbsp;&nbsp;O, in —&nbsp;&nbsp;O, San Francisco —&nbsp;&nbsp;U-LOC (Location).</p><h3>Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)</h3><p>CRFs are statistical tools that help make structured predictions. They consider the context and relationships between nearby tokens. CRFs are quite practical for custom named entity recognition, which involve labeling sequences.</p><p>In the sentence “Samsung announced the new Galaxy Buds in California,” Samsung is marked as an organization (B-ORG), Galaxy Buds as a product (B-PROD), and California as a location (B-LOC). CRFs use the context and relationships between words to identify these distinctions.</p></div></div><div class=\\\"Article_contentStyles__FOoh1\\\" data-id=\\\"1803\\\"><h2>NER Methodologies</h2><div class=\\\"\\\"><p>Named entity recognition data augmentation uses different methodologies to help identify and classify names and other specific entities in large texts. Let's see what they are.</p><h3>Named Entity Recognition Methods Based on Rules</h3><p>Rule-based methods often use linguistic patterns, expressions, or dictionaries. They are effective in tasks like extracting standard medical terms from clinical notes. Yet, rule-based techniques can't handle a large&nbsp;named entity recognition dataset because they follow fixed rules.</p><h3>Statistical Methods</h3><p>Statistical methods, like&nbsp; Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), use probabilities learned from training data to indicate named entities. These methods work well with lots of labeled data because they can adapt to different types of text.&nbsp;</p><h3>Machine Learning Methods&nbsp;</h3><p><a href=\\\"https://sapient.pro/blog/best-programming-languages-for-machine-learning\\\">Machine learning techniques&nbsp;</a>use algorithms like support vector machines and decision trees to learn from labeled data and predict specific named entities. These techniques help run large datasets and complex patterns.&nbsp;</p><h3>Deep Learning Methods</h3><p>Deep learning methods are the latest development that uses neural networks. Techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and transformers are popular because they can handle long-term text patterns. These methods work great for big tasks with lots of training data, but they require a lot of computing power.</p><h3>Hybrid Methodologies</h3><p>No single method works for every situation in NER. So, this led to the development of hybrid methods. They use a mix of rules, stats, and machine learning to get the best of each. For example, rule-based methods can work with specific entities in a particular field, while machine learning or deep learning is better for identifying more general entities.</p></div></div><div class=\\\"Article_contentStyles__FOoh1\\\" data-id=\\\"1804\\\"><h2>Use Cases for Named Entity Recognition</h2><div class=\\\"\\\"><p>NER has changed how different businesses and industries operate by efficiently processing large datasets. Here are some key&nbsp;named entity recognition use cases.</p><h3>News Search</h3><p>News companies create online content daily. NER helps automatically identify the who, what, when, where, and why in news and other articles. It highlights key details and helps understand the context better.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're searching for information about a celebrity or a particular event, NER can categorize articles based on the entities they mention. For example, if you want to find news about Mark Zuckerberg, an NER-powered platform can suggest articles that mention “Mark Zuckerberg” or “Facebook,” even if these terms aren't in the headlines.</p><h3>Chatbots</h3><p>Chatbots use NER to understand user questions. By identifying key information, like names or places, they can accurately respond. For example, if a person asks a chatbot to find a fast casual restaurant in the City Hall Park, NER helps the chatbot identify entities such as the type of food (fast casual), the type of place (restaurants), and the location (City Hall Park).</p><h3>Scientific research</h3><p>An online journal or publication platform hosts millions of research papers and academic articles. With possibly hundreds of papers on the same topic, organizing this information can be quite challenging. For example, with about 100,000 publications on Machine Learning, tagging them by key topics makes it easy to find articles on how two-layer neural networks learn.</p><h3>Legal documentation</h3><p>Legal documents, especially contracts, provide important information about the parties and specifics like duration and scope. Tracking these details is a must to manage contracts and avoid accidental renewals. NER automatically finds key details like names and dates in long documents.</p><h3>Pharmaceuticals and healthcare</h3><p>The healthcare system has about<a href=\\\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6372467/#:~:text=The%20big%20problem%20of%20healthcare,image%2C%20signal%2C%20etc.)\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\"> 80% of unstructured medical data.&nbsp;</a>NER helps identify and organize medical information like treatments, drugs, diseases, tests, and medication names in different documents. For example, tagging promotional materials makes it easier for medical representatives to find and share the most relevant information with healthcare professionals.</p><h3>Cybersecurity</h3><p>NER helps companies detect potential threats in network logs and other security data. The tool detects suspicious URLs, IP addresses, filenames, and usernames. This makes the network more secure and helps with safety investigations.</p><h3>Finance</h3><p>In finance, NER helps identify trends and improve risk assessments. It not only manages financial data like loans and earnings reports, but also analyzes company mentions on social media. This also helps to track events that might affect stock prices.</p><h3>Social Media</h3><p>Businesses use NER in social media analysis because it helps them find mentions of their brands, products, or competitors in conversations. This information helps improve brand reputation and create more targeted marketing strategies.</p></div><figure class=\\\"Article_imageBlock__JlKMT\\\"><div class=\\\"Article_image__QmZ2p\\\"><img alt=\\\"article image\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1296\\\" height=\\\"1386\\\" decoding=\\\"async\\\" data-nimg=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; viewBox=&#x27;0 0 1296 1386&#x27;%3E%3Cfilter id=&#x27;b&#x27; color-interpolation-filters=&#x27;sRGB&#x27;%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=&#x27;20&#x27;/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=&#x27;1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1&#x27; result=&#x27;s&#x27;/%3E%3CfeFlood x=&#x27;0&#x27; y=&#x27;0&#x27; width=&#x27;100%25&#x27; height=&#x27;100%25&#x27;/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=&#x27;out&#x27; in=&#x27;s&#x27;/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=&#x27;SourceGraphic&#x27;/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=&#x27;20&#x27;/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=&#x27;100%25&#x27; height=&#x27;100%25&#x27; x=&#x27;0&#x27; y=&#x27;0&#x27; preserveAspectRatio=&#x27;none&#x27; style=&#x27;filter: url(%23b);&#x27; href=&#x27;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD/2wBDAAUDBAQEAwUEBAQFBQUGBwwIBwcHBw8LCwkMEQ8SEhEPERETFhwXExQaFRERGCEYGh0dHx8fExciJCIeJBweHx7/2wBDAQUFBQcGBw4ICA4eFBEUHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh4eHh7/wAARCAAKAAoDAREAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgQH/8QAIBAAAgIBAwUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQASEyEEFEFhof/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDXJJITFvqSgdLbULqvPzLUg5LKjSue2ha2JsR8HFUVxs2vp11GtscXmZDk7MJ5ACQAxoX7xC//2Q==&#x27;/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\\\" srcSet=\\\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsapientpro.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com%2FDark_3_bef01613af.webp&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsapientpro.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com%2FDark_3_bef01613af.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x\\\" src=\\\"/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsapientpro.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com%2FDark_3_bef01613af.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\\\"/></div></figure></div><div class=\\\"Article_contentStyles__FOoh1\\\" data-id=\\\"1805\\\"><h2>NER Examples</h2><div class=\\\"\\\"><p>Named Entity Recognition lets systems understand the context of words.

Let's go through them so you can better understand how the process works.</p><h3>Step #1: Setting Goals</h3><p>Decide which entities to recognize, like people and places, and how you'll use NER, such as for extracting information.</p><h3>Step #2: Data preparation</h3><p>Start by collecting the data with the entities you need. Use tools like SpaCy Prodigy or datasets like CoNLL-03 to tag them. Next, clean and preprocess the data to fix any issues with punctuation or special characters.</p><h3>Step #3: Deciding on Approach</h3><p>Choose from different methods like:</p><ul><li>Rule-based approaches that use set rules for certain tasks;</li><li>Machine Learning techniques, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs);</li><li>Deep learning tools.</li></ul><h3>Step #4: Building the Model</h3><p>Pick a library like SpaCy or Transformers. You can train a model from the beginning or adjust an existing one for your special needs.</p><h3>Step #5: Model Assessment</h3><p>Measure how well your model performs using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. Also, test it on various datasets to ensure it works properly with new data.</p><h3>Step #6: Deployment and Integration</h3><p>Integrate the NER model into your application and make sure it works with other tools and processes.</p><h3>Step #7: Maintenance</h3><p>Regularly check the model performance in real-world situations and update it as needed.</p><h3>Step #8: Solving Challenges</h3><p>In this last phase, manage any uncertainties and differences in identifying entities. You can adjust the model to fit the language and requirements of your field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using an&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/api\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">API&nbsp;</a>can make it much easier to set up&nbsp;named entity recognition software. These APIs are available online or as local tools that offer NER features. For example,&nbsp;Stanford Named Entity Recognizer is a popular Java tool used for extracting entities. It uses Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and comes with a pre-trained&nbsp;named entity recognition model&nbsp;to identify entities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re interested in&nbsp;how to do named entity recognition in Python, the&nbsp;Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a helpful open-source tool for processing human language data. It's easy to use and works with over 100 pre-trained&nbsp;large language models for named entity recognition. NLTK offers tools for tasks like named entity recognition classification, stemming, tokenization, parsing, tagging, and understanding meaning. It includes a named entity recognizer (`ne_chunk`) and can be used with the Stanford NER in Python.</p></div></div><div class=\\\"Article_contentStyles__FOoh1\\\" data-id=\\\"1807\\\"><h2>Recent Trends in Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Its Future</h2><div class=\\\"\\\"><p>Let's check out some predictions for the future of Named Entity Recognition (NER).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, experts believe pairing named entity recognition with knowledge graphs, large databases that show how different entities are connected, will improve its performance. This could make NER more precise and help discover new entities more easily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next, named entity recognition could play a more significant role in voice assistants and chatbots, like ChatGPT. Recent stats show that&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cases.media/en/article/the-chatbot-market-in-2024-forecasts-and-latest-statistics\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">67% of clients use chatbots</a> for customer support, while chatbots manage 64% of routine requests.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As these technologies become more popular, it's important to identify specific parts of speech or text to understand what users want and give the right response. If a customer asks the chatbot, \\\"I lost my phone in London yesterday. Can you help me block my number?\\\" a NER system will identify a phone as a PRODUCT, London as a LOCATION, and yesterday as a DATE.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A chatbot will be able to quickly share location services and temporarily block a customer's number. This will make support service faster and more efficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as big data,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://sapient.pro/blog/how-to-build-ai-software\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">artificial intelligence</a>, and the Internet of Things expand, companies will use named entity recognition for cybersecurity and fraud detection. NER can interpret large amounts of data to find potential threats, which helps protect people and companies from cyberattacks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\\\"https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2019/73142/73142.pdf\", \"source\": \"web\", \"published_date\": \"N/A\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"2206.07318v1\", \"title\": \"CMNEROne at SemEval-2022 Task 11: Code-Mixed Named Entity Recognition by leveraging multilingual data\", \"authors\": [\"Suman Dowlagar\", \"Radhika Mamidi\"], \"abstract\": \"Identifying named entities is, in general, a practical and challenging task in the field of Natural Language Processing.

But much work hasn't been done for complex named entity recognition in Bangla, despite being the seventh most spoken language globally. CNER is a more challenging task than traditional NER as it involves identifying and classifying complex and compound entities, which are not common in Bangla language. In this paper, we present the winning solution of Bangla Complex Named Entity Recognition Challenge - addressing the CNER task on BanglaCoNER dataset using two different approaches, namely Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and finetuning transformer based Deep Learning models such as BanglaBERT.\\n  The dataset consisted of 15300 sentences for training and 800 sentences for validation, in the .conll format. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset revealed that the dataset had 7 different NER tags, with notable presence of English words, suggesting that the dataset is synthetic and likely a product of translation.\\n  We experimented with a variety of feature combinations including Part of Speech (POS) tags, word suffixes, Gazetteers, and cluster information from embeddings, while also finetuning the BanglaBERT (large) model for NER. We found that not all linguistic patterns are immediately apparent or even intuitive to humans, which is why Deep Learning based models has proved to be the more effective model in NLP, including CNER task.

The proposed technique does this by considering lexical, semantic and syntactic features to determine the passage from the corpus that most likely contains the answer to the posed question. The lexical features are obtained by considering the n-grams of the terms present in question/relevant data. The semantic features are generated using NLP tools and knowledge bases like WordNet and Wikipedia. The syntactic features are derived from the parse tree of question/relevant data. Finally, the answer extraction from the ranked data is performed by using answer type matches as well as syntactic matches. The technique is shown to work efficiently with a factoid based QA System but can be extended to subjective QAs as well, as the features considered are not specific to factoid Questions and Passages.

A survey [2]of all the state-of-the-art lexical passage ranking algorithms like Mitre, IBM, bm25, etc. indicates the scope for improvement in them and also notes that the passage retrieval performance depends on document retriever as well. [3] Paper describes and compares the various methods of passage ranking right from the initial n-gram and tf-idf measures to more recent Syntactic and Semantic measures like the SSTK[4] in the context of complex question answering.</P><P>With respect to this paper, the SSTK[4]and AType-DP-IP[5] techniques are the most relevant ones as both of these methods consider all the three category of features that we consider. It is to be noted that most of the work prior to these considered a subset of the features and hence, will be inferior in performance as we show in the experiments section. Works like [6], use semantic and syntactic techniques, but do not consider lexical techniques such as mismatch and inverse passage frequency (ipf). Other techniques like [7], don’t consider semantic similarities and employ the use of ontologies like Wordnet[8]. SSTK[4] is a kernel function proposed for automatic question categorization and it incorporates syntactic dependencies and term similarity based on WordNet[8]. The same kernel is used for Question Answering [3] and is shown to outperform prior passage ranking techniques.

When designing a ranking component for the library catalogue, an individual weighting of applicable factors is necessary.

Such models are fine-tuned based on the query-document/query-passage level relevance labels to capture the ranking signals. However, the documents are longer than the passages and such document ranking models suffer from the token limitation (512) of BERT. Researchers proposed ranking strategies that either truncate the documents beyond the token limit or chunk the documents into units that can fit into the BERT. In the later case, the relevance labels are either directly transferred from the original query-document pair or learned through some external model. In this paper, we conduct a detailed study of the design decisions about splitting and label transfer on retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We find that direct transfer of relevance labels from documents to passages introduces label noise that strongly affects retrieval effectiveness for large training datasets. We also find that query processing times are adversely affected by fine-grained splitting schemes.

Retrieval offers downstream QA systems grounding information, which not only improves accuracy in a lot of cases but also provides transparency to how systems gen- erate answers, similar to how articles provide refer- ences and citations, such that model hallucinations can be checked with ease. Furthermore, the set of documentstoberetrievedfrom, orknowledgebase, can be quickly updated with new documents and knowledge such that models can adapt to tempo- ral changes, and do not need to be continuously re-trained nor require online training paradigms for continual learning. Early retrieval methods are typically based on term-matching, such as BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) or TF-IDF (Salton et al.,1975). Such meth- ods, called sparse retrievers, perform keyword</P><P>1Source code is available at https://github.com/ wfangtw/jpr</P><P>matching efciently with an inverted index to nd relevant contexts. Sparse retrievers often achieve reasonable performance while being computation- ally efcient and does not require training, but are shown to have limited abilities beyond lexical matching. Recently, dense retrievers that encode text with continuous embeddings have been heavily stud- ied and utilized in contemporary QA systems, of- ten outperforming their sparse counterparts on high resource evaluation settings (Karpukhin et al., 2020). There are a few drawbacks however, such as higher computational demands during both train- ing and inference, inability to handle large con- texts (Luan et al.,2021), and difculty in gener- alizing to new domains especially those with lim- ited data (Reddy et al.,2021).

Introduction</H3><P>With the exponential burst of textual data, demands in condensing volu-minous text contents have been ubiquitous, bringing document summarization one of the most immensely researched</P><P>elds in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Document Summarization (DS) aims to generate an abridged version of single or multiple topic-related texts as concise and coherent as possible while preserving the salient and factually consistent information [1]. The document summarization task with a single input document is known as the Single Docu-ment Summarization (SDS). By contrast, the Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) task emphasizes synthesizing a large number of topic-related documents to generate a compressed summary from various times and perspectives. In addition, there are two general methods in document summarization: 1) the Extractive Document Summarization (EDS) method respects the lexicon of the original text, regarding the summary formation is verbatim by key words and phrases selected from the source corpus; and 2) the Abstractive Document Sum-marization (ADS) method respects the semantics of the original text, regarding the summary construction is by rephrasing texts according to the comprehension of text substances.

However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08302v3\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302v3\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2023-06-14T07:15:26Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"1908.02146v2\", \"title\": \"Knowledge Query Network: How Knowledge Interacts with Skills\", \"authors\": [\"Jinseok Lee\", \"Dit-Yan Yeung\"], \"abstract\": \"Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to trace the knowledge of students as they solve a sequence of problems represented by their related skills. This involves abstract concepts of students' states of knowledge and the interactions between those states and skills. Therefore, a KT model is designed to predict whether students will give correct answers and to describe such abstract concepts. However, existing methods either give relatively low prediction accuracy or fail to explain those concepts intuitively. In this paper, we propose a new model called Knowledge Query Network (KQN) to solve these problems. KQN uses neural networks to encode student learning activities into knowledge state and skill vectors, and models the interactions between the two types of vectors with the dot product. Through this, we introduce a novel concept called \\\\textit{probabilistic skill similarity} that relates the pairwise cosine and Euclidean distances between skill vectors to the odds ratios of the corresponding skills, which makes KQN interpretable and intuitive.\\n  On four public datasets, we have carried out experiments to show the following: 1. KQN outperforms all the existing KT models based on prediction accuracy. 2. The interaction between the knowledge state and skills can be visualized for interpretation. 3. Based on probabilistic skill similarity, a skill domain can be analyzed with clustering using the distances between the skill vectors of KQN. 4. For different values of the vector space dimensionality, KQN consistently exhibits high prediction accuracy and a strong positive correlation between the distance matrices of the skill vectors.\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02146v2\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02146v2\", \"source\": \"arxiv\", \"published_date\": \"2019-08-03T14:33:10Z\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"2311.17771v1\", \"title\": \"Supervising the Centroid Baseline for Extractive Multi-Document Summarization\", \"authors\": [\"Simão Gonçalves\", \"Gonçalo Correia\", \"Diogo Pernes\", \"Afonso Mendes\"], \"abstract\": \"The centroid method is a simple approach for extractive multi-document summarization and many improvements to its pipeline have been proposed.

In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and 9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content. These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training or task-specific tuning.</P><TABLE><TR><TD>Subjects:</TD><TD>Computation and Language (cs.CL)</TD></TR><TR><TD>Cite as:</TD><TD>arXiv:2505.22950 [cs.CL]</TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD>(or arXiv:2505.22950v1 [cs.CL] for this version)</TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD>https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.22950\\nFocus to learn more\\narXiv-issued DOI via DataCite</TD></TR></TABLE><H2>Submission history</H2><H1>Bibliographic and Citation Tools</H1><P>Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)</P><P>Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)</P><P>Litmaps (What is Litmaps?)</P><P>scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)</P>\", \"url\": \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22950\", \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22950.pdf\", \"source\": \"web\", \"published_date\": \"N/A\", \"score_bm25\": 0.0}, {\"paper_id\": \"2509.20461v1\", \"title\": \"Document Summarization with Conformal Importance Guarantees\", \"authors\": [\"Bruce Kuwahara\", \"Chen-Yuan Lin\", \"Xiao Shi Huang\", \"Kin Kwan Leung\", \"Jullian Arta Yapeter\", \"Ilya Stanevich\", \"Felipe Perez\", \"Jesse C.

While several surveys exist, most concentrate on studies prior to 2019, leaving a gap in systematically reviewing the rapid advances in deep learning–driven summarization. This paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of challenges, methodologies, and emerging directions in automatic text summarization. We categorize summarization techniques into six dimensions: Input Document Number, Summary Language, Output Requirements, Summary Content, Domain Applicability, and Semantic Relationship, with particular emphasis on extractive and abstractive methods. Specifi-cally, we synthesize nine representative extractive approaches and three abstractive approaches developed over the past seventy years, and present performance comparisons across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify seven promising future research avenues.
