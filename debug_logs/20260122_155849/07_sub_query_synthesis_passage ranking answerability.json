{"executive_summary": "**Executive Summary: Passage Ranking with an Emphasis on Answerability**\n\nThis review synthesizes recent research advancements in passage ranking for open-domain question answering (QA), with a focus on methods that incorporate or improve answerability assessment alongside relevance estimation.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Emerging Paradigms in Passage Reranking**\nRecent works explore diverse strategies to enhance passage reranking efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness. These approaches span:\n\n- **Multi-view non-generative architectures** (MVP) that encode query–passage pairs into orthogonal semantic views for single-step global ranking. This design eliminates autoregressive generation overhead, mitigates position/selection biases, and achieves strong performance with reduced computational cost.\n  \n- **Answer-oriented generative adversarial frameworks** (PReGAN) that explicitly model answerability in addition to relevance, using weak supervision to combat noisy labels. This lightweight design demonstrates that fewer candidates can still yield high QA accuracy when answerability is prioritized.\n\n- **Parameter-efficient prompt tuning** (PSPT) methods that replace static hand-crafted prompts with learnable passage-specific soft prompts, significantly boosting reranking performance without full LLM fine-tuning. PSPT integrates passage embeddings with trainable soft prompts to better capture passage-specific context.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Integration of Answerability into Ranking**\nThe primary goal—answerability-aware passage ranking—is addressed most directly by **PReGAN**, which treats answerability as a first-class signal in its discriminator-based ranking model. While other models like PSPT and MVP focus more on relevance optimization, their architectures could be adapted for answerability by incorporating discriminative features or likelihood-based scoring conditioned on answer presence.\n\n**Key insight:** Explicit modeling of answerability yields measurable gains in downstream QA performance, especially when combined with methods that optimize ranking efficiency and robustness.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Efficiency and Robustness Trade-offs**\n- **MVP** offers highly efficient, bias-resistant ranking by avoiding generative inference and enabling listwise scoring in one pass.\n- **PSPT** achieves efficiency via parameter reduction, enabling practical deployment on large LLMs without retraining the entire model.\n- **PReGAN** remains lightweight while adding answerability modeling, though its GAN-based training introduces complexity.\n\nEfficiency considerations are crucial for real-world QA systems, where ranking latency directly impacts user experience.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Complementary Advances in Retrieval Foundations**\nSupporting innovations include:\n- **Retrieval Oriented Masking (ROM)**: Improves dense retriever pre-training by masking informative tokens, indirectly boosting relevance and potential answerability.\n- **Zero-shot question generation (UPR)**: Applies unsupervised PLMs to re-rank passages based on generated questions, demonstrating strong performance without labeled data.\n- **Passage-level label transfer (Qa-DocRank)**: Reduces inference cost by selectively transferring document labels to relevant passages, preserving accuracy.\n\nThese foundational retrieval enhancements can be paired with answerability-aware rerankers for compounded benefits.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Strategic Recommendations for Answerability-Aware Passage Ranking**\n- **Hybridization**: Combine MVP’s efficiency and bias mitigation with PReGAN’s explicit answerability modeling for a scalable, high-performance reranker.\n- **Prompt-based answerability cues**: Integrate PSPT’s passage-specific soft prompts with answerability-focused scoring functions to leverage LLM contextual understanding.\n- **Data efficiency**: Use weak supervision and label transfer methods (Qa-DocRank) to maintain high performance with limited training data.\n- **Retrieval optimization**: Employ ROM or UPR to improve initial candidate quality before reranking, increasing the likelihood of answer-containing passages in the top set.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe frontier in passage ranking for QA is shifting toward models that jointly optimize relevance and answerability, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency. MVP, PSPT, and PReGAN represent complementary approaches—non-generative multi-view ranking, parameter-efficient contextual tuning, and explicit answerability modeling—that can be integrated into a unified framework. Coupled with improved retrieval pre-training and zero-shot re-ranking methods, such systems promise robust, scalable, and answer-focused QA performance across domains."}
